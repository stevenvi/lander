To install this software, the provided makefile should work.
You will need to have the Allegro 4, DUMB, and ALDUMB libraries installed.

You will have to hand edit the makefile to switch between debugging
and release builds.  You can check it yourself, just uncomment the 
appropriate DEBUG and LDFLAGS variables at the top of the file.

I used GCC v4.1.1 to compile this.


If you try compiling this with MSVC, I cannot help you, as I have
stopped using that compiler now that I have a fast enough computer
where I can do all my development in Linux.
