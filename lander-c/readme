----------------

This is a mostly stable build of LANDER!.  Please report any
bugs to steven.t.wallace @at@ gmail.com.  I am already aware
of a few, but it seems that when I fix most bugs I introduce
new ones.  Patches are always welcome and in fact preferred.

I am mostly lazy.  I hope that the game speaks for itself.
Give it a play and hack around with it if you like.
